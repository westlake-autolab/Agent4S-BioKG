## Introduction
Pursuing artificial intelligence for biomedical science, a.k.a. AI Scientist, draws increasing attention, where one common approach is to build a copilot agent driven by Large Language Models~(LLMs).   
However, to evaluate such systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering~(QA) to the LLM itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce `BioKGBench`.   
In contrast to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle **Understanding Literature** into two atomic abilities, i) **Understanding** the unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph Question-Answering~(KGQA) as a form of **Literature** grounding. We then formulate a novel agent task, dubbed KGCheck, using KGQA and domain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify the factual errors of existing large-scale knowledge graph databases.   We collect over two thousand data for two atomic tasks and 225 high-quality annotated data for the agent task. Surprisingly, we discover that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on our benchmark. We then introduce a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed `BKGAgent`. On the widely used popular dataset, we discover over 90 factual errors which yield the effectiveness of our approach, yields substantial value for both the research community or practitioners in the biomedical domain.

<summary>Dataset(Need to <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/AutoLab-Westlake/BioKGBench-Dataset">download</a> from huggingface)</summary>

* **bioKG**: The knowledge graph used in the dataset.
* **KGCheck**: Given a knowledge graph and a scientific claim, the agent needs to check whether the claim is supported by the knowledge graph. The agent can interact with the knowledge graph by asking questions and receiving answers.
  * **Dev**: 20 samples
  * **Test**: 205 samples
  * **corpus**: 51 samples
* **KGQA**: Given a knowledge graph and a question, the agent needs to answer the question based on the knowledge graph.
  * **Dev**: 60 samples
  * **Test**: 638 samples
* **SCV**: Given a scientific claim and a research paper, the agent needs to check whether the claim is supported by the research paper.

## News and Updates
[2024-06-06] `BioKGBench` v0.1.0 is released.

## Installation
This project has provided an environment setting file of conda, users can easily reproduce the environment by the following commands:
```bash
conda create -n agent4s-biokg python=3.10
conda activate agent4s-biokg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

**Obtaining dataset**:
The dataset can be found in the [release]. The dataset is divided into three parts: `KGCheck`, `KGQA`, and `SCV`, every part is split into `Dev` and `Test`.
[[ðŸ¤— BioKGBench-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AutoLab-Westlake/BioKGBench-Dataset)]
```git
git lfs install
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/AutoLab-Westlake/BioKGBench-Dataset ./data
cd data
git lfs pull
```

**Building Knowledge Graph**:  
```bash
# TODO
```

**Running Baseline**:
* Config  
You need to modify the configuration file in the `config` folder, including `kg_config.yml`, and `llm_config.yml`.

* `KGCheck`:  
  run experiment  
  **--data_file**: the path of the dataset file.
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.KGCheck.team --data_file data/kgcheck/dev.json
  ```
  evaluate  
  **--history_file**: the path of the log file.  
  **--golden_answer_file**: the path of the golden answer file.
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.KGCheck.evalutation.evaluate --history_file results/kgcheck/log_1718880808.620556.txt --golden_answer_file data/kgcheck/dev.json
  ```
* `KGQA`:   
  change config  
  **tasks/KGQA/configs/tasks/kg.yaml**: update task config, change data path as your own path.  
  **tasks/KGQA/configs/agents/*.yaml**: make agent config file, choose one of these agents or make your own agent.  
  **tasks/KGQA/configs/assignments/default.yaml**: update llm config, change agent if you make you won.
  start contoller and worker  
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.KGQA.start_task -a
  ```
  Open another terminal and run:
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.KGQA.assigner
  ```
* `SCV`:  
  start embedding api server:
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.SCV.embedding.webapi
  ```
  start SCV task:
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.SCV.scv_lc -d data/scv/dev.jsonl
  ```
  analysis:  
  ```bash
  python -m tasks.SCV.analysis -r results/svc/dev_1718903779.497523_answer_Qwen1.5-72B-Chat.jsonl
